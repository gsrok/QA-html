						<ul>* Do you consider yourself more of a designer or developer (or something else, other answers are acceptable)?
							<br>
						I consider myself more of a designer/artist/creator</ul>
						<ul>* What are you most interested in learning in this class?
							<br>
						Aesthetics in web design. Making something look good from an idea.</ul>
						<ul>* What is good design?
						<br>
						Good design is when something is created with the point as clear, and clever as can be. A medium between art and functionality </ul>
						<ul>* What is good web design?
						<br>
						Good web design is when a website looks, functions and embodies good design, clarity, and an enjoyable experience. </ul>
						<ul>* What are the good examples of conference/event web sites? Answer by listing at least two sites including each URL and why you chose the site.
						<br>
						<a href="http://www.eventsy.com">Eventsys</a>      - This website has a simplistic approach with very nice "flat" design. They use colors that pop, and simplistic icons. Clear, simple, and full of character. 
						<br>
						<a href="http://barcampomaha.org">BarCamp Omaha</a>     - I chose this site because of the friendly, fun, and thoughtful design. It has a very unique flow all throughout the website. Nice images and good color scheme.
